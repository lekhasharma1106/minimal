### Finance And Risk Analytics

In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Every individual or business actively searches for opportunities to get the maximum returns. However, in most of the cases, they either lack the skills to identify the right investment opportunity, or there is a shortage of time for finding these opportunities. Hence, this gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission - Portfolio managers.

A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realise the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments along with the right allocation. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best solution to the investor.

Consider yourself working for an associate at an investment firm that manages accounts for private clients. The role requires us to analyse a portfolio of stocks to provide consultation on investment management based on clientâ€™s requirement.

### Bike Sharing Prediction 

This project is a programming project wherein we have build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
### Business Goal
we are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## EDA- Bank Loan

This project aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this project, apart from applying the techniques that we have learnt in the EDA module, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

### Business Objectives

The company wants to understand the driving factors(or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
